This repository holds my summary and solutions for Leetcode problems, data structure, and algorithms. Here is the [weblink](https://rogerluo-code.github.io/coding-practice/)

## Recommended Problem Solving Procedures
* Clarifications (e.g., data type, sorted or unsorted)
* Go through some examples
* Solution
    - Assumptions
    - Input/output (signature)
    - Corner cases: empty array
    - Algorithm
    - Time/space complexity
* Coding
* Test
    - Test corner cases
    - Test general cases
