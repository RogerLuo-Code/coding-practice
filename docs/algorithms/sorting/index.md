# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are a class of algorithms that put elements of a list in a certain order. The most common orders are numerical order and lexicographical order. The algorithms differ in their method of sorting, their efficiency, and their use cases.

## Types of Sorting Algorithms

There are several types of sorting algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Shell Sort
- [Quick Sort](quick-sort.md)
- [Merge Sort](merge-sort.md)
- [Heap Sort](heap-sort.md)
- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Radix Sort
- Tim Sort
