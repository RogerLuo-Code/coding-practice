# Tips for Sorted Array or Matrix

In an interview, whenever you're given a question where the input array is sorted, here
are some super useful things to consider:

- [Binary Search](../search/binary-search.md)
- Two (or three) pointers
- A sliding window
- Traversing from the right

For row-wise and column-wise sorted matrix:

- [Binary Search](../search/binary-search.md)
- [Staircase Traversal](../../algorithms/search/staircase-traversal.md)

Make sure to write down a couple examples and try experimenting with these approaches.
Even understanding that these approaches may aid in finding an answer with a sorted
array, you're showing your interviewer that you have a good understanding of the array
data structure. Be mindful of **negative** values and **duplicates** as you're experimenting!
