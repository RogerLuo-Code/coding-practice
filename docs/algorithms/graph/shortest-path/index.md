# Overview of Single Source Shortest Path

Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is used to find the shortest path in **unweighted**
graphs.

For a weighted graph, the BSF doesn't work. There are two common single source shortest
path algorithms.

1. Dijkstra's algorithm (only works with **non-negative** weights)
2. Bellman-Ford algorithm (works with any weights)

**Edge relaxation** is to select the shortest path between two nodes.
