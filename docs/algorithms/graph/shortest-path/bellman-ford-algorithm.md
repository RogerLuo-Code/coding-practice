# Bellman Ford Algorithm

## Basic Theorem

**Theorem 1**: In a graph with no negative-weight cycles with N vertices, the shortest path
between any two vertices has at most $n - 1$ edges.

Negative-weight cycle: sum of weights in the cycle < 0.

**Theorem 2**: In a graph with negative-weight cycles, there is no shortest path.
