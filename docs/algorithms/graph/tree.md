# Tree in Graph Theory

A tree in graph theory is a special case of a graph, defined as a **connected** **acyclic**
**undirected** graph.

The graph theory tree can be:

- Rooted trees: one node is designated as the root. This is similar to [tree ADTs](../../abstract-data-type/tree.md).
- Unrooted trees: no designated root, often used in network topology)

## Properties

- N nodes and N - 1 edges (since tree is connected)
- No cycles
- Unique path between any two nodes
