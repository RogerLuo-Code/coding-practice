# Priority Queue

## Introduction

A priority queue is an **abstract data type** similar to a regular queue or stack
abstract data type. Each element in a priority queue has an associate priority. In a
priority queue, elements with high priority are served before elements with low priority.

## Priority Queue vs. Heaps

- A priority queue is an **abstract data type** like a list or a map.
- Heaps are **data structure** that can be used to implement priority queue.

Just as list (an abstract data type) can be implemented with a linked list or with an
array (data structure). A priority queue can be implemented with a heap or another
method such as an ordered array.
